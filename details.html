                    <h2>First proverb</h2>
                    <p>The Pashto proverb "انسان تر کاڼی کلک او تر گل نازک دی" means that a human being has a complex nature, capable of being both incredibly strong and deeply fragile. It reflects the idea that people can endure immense hardships, showing resilience and toughness even greater than stone, yet at the same time, they can be emotionally sensitive and vulnerable, more delicate than a flower. This saying reminds us not to judge others by appearances alone, as beneath someone’s strength may lie hidden pain, and behind someone’s gentleness may be great endurance. It encourages empathy, understanding, and respect for the emotional depth and strength that coexist within every human being.</p>

                    <h2>Second proverb</h2>
                    <p>This proverb conveys the idea that every action has a consequence. Just like a farmer who plants seeds and later harvests the same crop, a person will eventually face the results of their deeds — whether good or bad. If you do good things like being honest, kind, and hardworking, you will receive positive outcomes such as success, respect, and happiness. On the other hand, if you engage in dishonesty, cruelty, or wrongdoing, you will face negative consequences like regret, failure, or punishment. The proverb teaches us to be mindful of our actions, because what we put out into the world is what will come back to us. It is a reminder of justice, accountability, and the moral balance of life.</p>

                    <h2>Third proverb</h2>
                    <p>
                        This proverb speaks to the lasting impact of a traumatic or painful experience. When someone has gone through a difficult or frightening situation—like being bitten by a snake—they become overly cautious or fearful, even of things that pose no real threat—like a harmless rope that only resembles a snake. It highlights how fear and trauma can linger in a person's mind and affect their behavior long after the original event has passed. This saying reminds us to be understanding toward those who are overly cautious or scared; their reaction may come from a past hurt or experience we do not see. It also teaches that fear is not always logical—it can be rooted in memory, not reality</p>

                    <h2>Fourth proverb</h2>
                    <p>This powerful proverb expresses the idea that love is not an easy or safe path—it is a journey filled with risks, sacrifices, emotional challenges, and deep vulnerability. Just as it takes a lion's courage to face danger, it takes immense bravery, patience, and strength to endure the ups and downs of true love. Love can bring joy and beauty, but also heartbreak and pain. Therefore, if someone lacks emotional strength or is afraid of being hurt, they are advised not to enter this intense and demanding experience. The proverb honors the depth and seriousness of love and reminds us that only the bold and strong-hearted can truly handle its trial</p>
